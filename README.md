DECO1800 Project

Hi guys!
This might be the first time you've used subversion/repositories, so I'm
just going to leave a little cheat sheet here.

To read this you'd already have to clone a repository, so I'm skipping that
bit.

Github is just a way for us to store the project and track changes to it. 
Two people can be editing the same code or file at once, and can merge later

Pulling code updates your local files to changes that are made on your repo
Committing code updates the repo with changes from your local files.

___________________________________________________________________________
Any file you make inside of ~/GitHub/DECO1800Project will show on github 
desktop.

After you make or edit a file, you need to commit it. This will upload 
and start tracking any changes to the file on the current branch.

Nothing you can do on your own computer will break anything on the main
branch until you push. You can play around with others code as much as
you want.

If you still want to use subversion while doing something radical/code 
breaking, you're probably going to want to branch. We wont have to do this
for a while.

Pushing to master isn't like saving a file. When you push you are 
saying that this is good enough for a working copy. As an example, don't 
push code that doesn't compile. It doens't have to be a finished product,
it just shouldn't break anything. 

However, you should commit often. Committing doesn't affect the main branch
until you push it. Commit history will be uploaded when you push.

Each commit should include:
	- Short header
	- Clear description of what was changed
	- (maybe) co-authors that helped with commit

Everything else is handled automatically.

    <h3 class="about-item">Data Source</h3>
    <p>The information displayed in the interactive map is retrieved from the Australian Governmentâ€™s Open Data Portal (data.gov.au). These data sources include marriage statistics by month, suburb and gender. We use these sets of data to determine whether the time provided by users is peak wedding season, which may lead to higher prices. The data was originally presented as a table, however, we will analyse and display it through a graphical and visual representation in the form of an interactive map.</p>
